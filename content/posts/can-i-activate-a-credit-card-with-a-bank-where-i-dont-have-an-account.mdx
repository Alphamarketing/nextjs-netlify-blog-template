A credit card is a particular payment card certifying the credit granted by the bank to its holder: it is in fact equipped with a credit line that allows you to pay even for amounts higher than those actually available on the account. 

Precisely for this reason, it is a service that is not granted to everyone with absolute lightness, but provides for checks on the income situation  of applicants. From what has just been said, it can be deduced that it will be much easier to obtain a credit card from a bank with which you are already an account holder. 

The credit institution, in fact, will know the credit situation of the individual account holder, therefore it may have greater or lesser difficulties in granting the issuance of a credit card which, in many cases, can also be with immediate results.

## Can I have a credit card with a different account than my own?

A credit card must necessarily be linked to a current account : there are some companies that issue credit cards (think, for example, of American Express), which require a current account to be associated with the card, or from which to withdraw the money spent. The account may be that of any other credit institution.  

It is clear that a bank has no interest in issuing a credit card to the account holder of another bank: the ideal would therefore be to choose a current account that provides both advantageous costs and the possibility of obtaining a credit card. in a short time . 

Usually part of the requirements underlying the issue are:

* the fact of having Italian or European citizenship;
* the crediting of the salary or pension;
* guarantees linked to the possession of certain income. 

Furthermore, there must be no debts or beings registered in the register of bad payers. The request for income guarantees by the bank is important as it represents a form of protection for the credit institution. 

Protection required for several reasons:

* on the one hand we have in fact the aforementioned credit line, which the bank grants “on loan” to the credit card holder: the latter is required to repay the amount obtained in advance in compliance with the provisions of the contractual conditions;
* on the other hand, in the event of a theft or counterfeiting of the card. 

However, today it is easier to get a credit card than in the past:

1. thanks to the fact that the requirements for owning one are much less strict than a few years ago;
2. by virtue of the increasing spread of online current accounts.

## How to apply for a credit card

The step that precedes the request for a credit card , to be used for online purchases and for those at physical stores, should be the activation of a current account. Considering that, in recent years, traditional accounts have been marked by various increases, what we recommend is to sign up for an online current account. 

The latter represents a zero-cost solution, with which you can save compared to the canonical costs of a current account. Specifically, it is:

* the cost of the monthly management fee;
* any stamp duty to be incurred for quarterly average stocks exceeding € 5,000;
* the costs applied to transactions such as wire transfers and cash withdrawals, in particular for those at ATMs of other banks.

The credit card can be requested immediately after activating the account, by presenting, in addition to your documents, the relative documentation certifying your income. Depending on the case, this could be:

* the paycheck, for the employee;
* the payslip, in the event that you are retired;
* the tax return, for self-employed workers;
* of the residence permit, if the applicant was resident in Italy but was not an Italian citizen. 

The request can be submitted directly online, through the home banking or mobile banking services , or by physically going to the bank branch (in this case you will have to bring the necessary documentation with you). 

Regarding the costs of credit cards , compared to other payment cards (debit cards and prepaid cards), which are usually at no cost, there is generally a monthly or annual fee. 

The rule provides that the greater the card ceiling, the greater the fee to be paid: this is because the credit card will in these cases be characterized by the presence of various additional services, which will make it a product far beyond a simple payment card. . 

In the case of online credit cards , however, it will be much easier to find low-cost solutions or even offers with which to take advantage of free credit cards for certain periods of time.

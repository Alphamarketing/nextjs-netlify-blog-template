(Teleborsa) - The expensive energy situation has "worsened after the aggression by Russia on Ukraine" and since the beginning of the conflict there has been a 40% rise in the price of gas and a doubling of the price of energy electricity . This was stated by Fabrizio Balassone , Head of the Economic Structure Service of [the Bank](https://www.indiacom.com/pune/hdfc-bank-pune-boat-club-branch_pune_pne_1225504.html) of Italy , during a hearing in the Chamber, underlining "we are all aware that in this phase of emergency the uncertainty about the economic prospects is higher".

The expert from Palazzo Koch warns that "if these increases were accompanied by a drastic reduction in imports from Russia, there would be significant negative effects on economic activity in Europe and Italy ", which are currently "difficult to quantify" , and a “Further increase in inflation”. with impacts on purchasing power and income. The fallout from the conflict - he explained - could be worth 2 percentage points of GDP in the Eurozone and "be relevant for our country as well".

"In the perspective of a protracted critical phase on the energy supply front, the support should become more targeted " on families and businesses - Balassone argues - "while paying attention to the effects on public accounts". The expert believes that the measures adopted so far "partially compensate for the energy price increases" which prove to be too vilified and sudden, but in perspective "the prices of carbon-based energy sources will have to gradually increase in order to guide the behavior of all (consumers, companies, investors) towards the goal of climate transition ".

"In order both to accelerate the diversification of the country's energy supply sources and to respect the environmental objectives agreed at European level, the measures to mitigate the increase in prices must be accompanied by greater recourse to other producers and containment policies of consumption ", underlines the expert of Via Nazionale, adding that" an extensive investment program will be implemented to increase the production of energy from renewable sources and the infrastructures necessary for the progressive electrification of energy uses ".

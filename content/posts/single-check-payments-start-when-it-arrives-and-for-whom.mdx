Excellent news for all those who have already applied for the new Single Allowance for dependent children. INPS, in collaboration with [the Bank](https://www.indiacom.com/pune/hdfc-bank-pune-boat-club-branch_pune_pne_1225504.html) of Italy, has in fact begun the payments of the first month 's single check for approximately 5 million beneficiary children, referring to approximately 3 million applications submitted between 1 January and 28 February 2022 .

We remind you that the single and universal allowance is an economic support to families awarded for each dependent child up to the age of 21 , subject to certain conditions, and without age limits for disabled children. The allowance is defined as unique because it brings together the previous aid to families, except one, with a view to simplification.

The amount due varies according to the economic condition of the family unit on the basis of the ISEE valid at the time of the application, taking into account the age and number of children as well as any situations of disability of the children. But it is guaranteed to a minimum extent to all families with dependent children, even in the absence of ISEE or with ISEE exceeding the threshold of 40 thousand euros.

It is paid by INPS and is paid to the applicant or, upon request even later, equally among those who exercise parental responsibility, by crediting a bank or postal current account, or by choosing the method of domiciled bank transfer.

Who is it for: the requirements

The single and universal allowance is for families in which these conditions are met:

for each dependent minor child and, for new born, it starts from the seventh month of pregnancy

for each dependent adult child, up to the age of 21 who:

\- attends a school or professional training course, or a degree course

\- is registered as unemployed and looking for a job with the public employment services

\- performs the universal civil service;

for each dependent child with disabilities, without age limits.

Here all the info on how to apply .

How much is due: the amounts

The amount of the single and universal allowance is determined on the basis of the ISEE presented by the beneficiary child's family unit, taking into account the age of the dependent children and numerous other elements ( here who will receive up to 2 thousand euros more ) .

In particular, it is envisaged:

a variable portion modulated progressively: ranging from a maximum of 175 euros for each minor child with an ISEE up to 15 thousand euros, to a minimum of 50 euros for each minor child in the absence of an ISEE or with an ISEE equal to or greater than 40 thousand euros . The amounts due for each child can be increased in the case of large families (for children after the second), mothers under the age of 21, families with 4 or more children, parents both with income from work, children with disabilities

a share by way of increases to compensate for any economic loss suffered by the family unit, if the amount of the allowance should be lower than that resulting from the sum of the theoretical values ​​of the allowance to the family unit (family component) and deductions average tax (fiscal component), which would have been received in the pre-reform regime.

What aids to families no longer exist because they have been replaced by the Single Check

We recall, precisely with a view to simplification and universality, that with the entry into force of the Single Check, from March 2022 all other measures to support the birth rate were abrogated , precisely because they were absorbed by the Check itself. except one. They therefore ceased to exist:

Mom tomorrow bonus (the birth or adoption bonus

allowance for families with at least 3 minor children;

family allowances for families with children and orphans;

Baby bonus (childbirth allowance)

tax deductions for children up to 21 years of age.

This is what emerged from the ABI monthly report on the Italian banking system. Compared to the maximum level of net bad loans, reached in November 2015 (88.8 billion), the reduction is therefore 70.7 billion (equal to -79.6%). The ratio of net non-performing loans to total loans is equal to 1.04% in January 2022, (it was 0.87% in December 2021, 1.14% in January 2021, 1.55% in January 2020 and 4.89% in November 2015).

In February 2022, loans to businesses and households increased by 2.3% compared to a year ago. This evidence emerges from the estimates based on data published by the Bank of Italy, relating to loans to businesses and households (calculated by including securitized loans and net of changes in stocks not connected with transactions, for example, changes due to exchange rate fluctuations , to value adjustments or to reclassifications). In January 2022, corporate loans increased by 0.9% on an annual basis. The increase is 4.0% for household loans.

As regards interest rates , in February 2022 on financing transactions remained at particularly low levels: the average rate on total loans was 2.15% (same value in the previous month and 6.18% before the crisis, at the end of 2007), while the average rate on new business financing transactions is 1.10% (1.12% the previous month; 5.48% at the end of 2007). The average rate on new home purchase transactions is 1.49% (1.45% the previous month, 5.72% at the end of 2007).

In Italy, in February 2022, the dynamics of total deposits (deposits from resident customers and bonds) grew by + 3.3% on an annual basis. Deposits (current accounts, certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements) increased, in the same month, by approximately â‚¬ 79 billion compared to a year earlier (variation of + 4.5% on an annual basis), while deposits in the medium and long term, ie through bonds, it has fallen, in the last 12 months, by approximately 12.9 billion euro in absolute value (equal to -6.0%).

In February 2022, the average interest rate on total bank deposits from customers (sum of deposits, bonds and repurchase agreements in euro to households and non-financial companies) was 0.44% in Italy, (same value in the previous month ). This is determined by the rate applied on deposits (current accounts, savings deposits and certificates of deposit), 0.31% (same value in the previous month), by the rate on repos, which stands at 1.20% (1, 02% the previous month) and the yield on outstanding bonds, 1.73% (1.71% in the previous month).

The spread between the average rate on loans and the average rate on deposits from households and non-financial companies remains in Italy at particularly low levels, in February 2022 it was 171 basis points (as in the previous month), a marked decline from over 300 basis points than before the financial crisis (335 basis points at the end of 2007).
